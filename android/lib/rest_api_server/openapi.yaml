  description: |-
    Alp android REST API server running on android side.

    In alp (android-linux-pam), the linux machine delegates the authentication decision
    (true or false) to the android device.

    One endpoint (/auth) is there to do exactly that.

    However, to prevent "anyone" (e.g. an attacker) from doing so, previous pairing is
    required (key exchange), since the messages sent via the /auth endpoint are encrypted.
    Pairing is done via the android app.
  version: 1.0.0
